### Understanding the differences between SOAP and REST

When I started coding, SOAP services were booming. Everyone used to use SOAP.
And SOAP was great, it worked really well for the enterprise applications that
I built. As my team was debating on should I use SOAP or REST, I read a lot about
which one makes sense.

Here are somethings you need to consider when choosing SOAP or REST

REST is more of an Architectural pattern than a protocol.
It follows a set of
constraints that we need to adhere.
+ Performance - how does my component interaction affect performance
+ Scalibility - should be able to support large number of components
+ Simplicity - of a common interface
+ Modifiability - meets evolving needs of the systems
+ Portability - of components by moving program code with the data
+ Reliability - resistance to fail
+ Visibility - clear communication between components

##Key actions in REST
  +post
  +get
  +put
  +delete
