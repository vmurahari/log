### How do leaders manage for unimaginable outcomes?

I came across this article on how to use physics laws to manage software team and while building products. This is really interesting to think about managing team dynamics, when to intervene and help the team, when to step back and watch the team solve issues and all through the lens of Quantum physics.

Thanks to Instagaram head of engineering for providing insights into desinging a team with few depdencies similar to software design

Have fun reading:
