### Program to extract XML from database

I wanted to write a program for one of my internal projects that will extract xml from database. The application mainly stored all of the data in XML. I needed to query the xml data from the database and parse the xml. My only requirement was, this needs to run really fast and I wanted something soon. 

Here is the code on github for anyone to use.
