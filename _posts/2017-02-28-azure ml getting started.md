I wanted to understand Azure ML and how Microsoft managed cloud service enables us to easily build, deploy, and share predictive analytics solution. Lot of free sources are available but here is a list of videos to help you get started with Azure ML. The videos are done by Data Science Dojo company and they are a good starting point to understand Azure ML studio, how to prepare data, split data, and apply ML algorithms. They also go further to tweak different models and how each model performs against each other.

A good starting point — they have around 10 videos.
